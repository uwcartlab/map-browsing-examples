# Map Browsing Examples

A series of examples designed to show different methods of panning and zooming in an interactive map. These examples are used in Geography 575: Interactive Cartogrpahy and Geovisualization to show how a single interactive primitive could have multiple forms of expression, some suited to particular uses. The examples shown are various in their levels of constraint, feedback, accessibility, and the affordances they offer the user. Several are specifically suited for mobile use.
